# London Bike Sharing - Tableau Dashboard
## Objective:
#### Create an interactive Tableau Dashboard on the London Bike Sharing dataset
## Tools used:
#### Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public
## Tasks Completed:
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning:**
      - Employed Python for thorough data exploration and cleaning of the London Bike Sharing dataset.
      - Renamed columns and standardized data for consistency.
      - Enhanced data readability by converting 'humidity' values to percentage and replacing coded values in 'season' and 'weather' columns with descriptive terms.
2. **Dashboard creation in Tableau:**
      - Developed an engaging and interactive dashboard in Tableau to provide insights into bike sharing patterns.
      - Implemented a dynamic moving average line chart allowing users to select different time periods and durations for analysis.
      - Incorporated a dynamic text element to display the total bike rides, adjusting based on the selected time period in the line chart.
      - Designed a heatmap illustrating bike ride patterns in relation to wind speed and temperature, with interactivity based on the selected time period.
      - Included horizontal bar charts to visualize ride counts by weather conditions and time of day, providing additional context to user analysis.
3. **Interactive Features:**
      - Integrated user-friendly filters for moving average duration and period to enhance dashboard flexibility.
      - Leveraged tooltips to display supplementary information such as bar charts when users hover over specific areas in the line chart or heatmap.
